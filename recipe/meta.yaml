  summary: A port of node.js's EventEmitter to python.
  description: |
    pyee supplies a EventEmitter object that is similar to the EventEmitter
    class from Node.js. It also supplies a number of subclasses with added
    support for async and threaded programming in python, such as async/await
    as seen in python 3.5+.
